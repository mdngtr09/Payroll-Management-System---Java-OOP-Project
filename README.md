Payroll Management System - Java OOP Project

This project was developed as part of a payroll management solution for a small company's HR department. It supports up to ten employees, both salaried and hourly, and handles payroll calculations based on individual employee data. The system allows for the application of salary adjustments and displays detailed information for each worker. Built using Java and key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, this project is designed to streamline payroll processes efficiently.
